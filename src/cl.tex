    At Ericsson, I utilized my strong quantitative abilities to extract valuable insights from extensive datasets and delve into the 
    implementation of machine learning models. The dynamic nature of these tasks required quick adaptation and mastery of skills including 
    Natural Language Processing (NLP), image processing, and data cleansing. These contributions augmented our team's comprehension of 
    data and significantly improved the accuracy of our models.

    In my tenure at Baker Hughes, I demonstrated an aptitude for cross-functional collaboration, engaging with a variety of teams 
    on a new product initiative. This project entailed a comprehensive design upgrade and the integration of new features. My focus on 
    outcomes was further evident as I spearheaded a company-wide standardization of tools. This strategic initiative resulted in 
    substantial resource savings across the organization.
